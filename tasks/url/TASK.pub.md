## Goal

Implement a MoonBit **WHATWG URL parser** compatible with the WHATWG URL
Standard and this repository’s WPT-based test suite (including setter
semantics). The authoritative references are vendored in:

- `url/specs/url.md`
- `url/specs/whatwg/`
- `url/specs/wpt/`

## What This Task Is Really About

This is an exercise in implementing the **WHATWG URL parsing algorithm** (a
state machine with many special cases), not an RFC 3986 URI splitter.

You must implement:

- canonical parsing + serialization
- host parsing (domain/IPv4/IPv6/opaque)
- relative resolution against a base URL
- the WHATWG-defined setter behaviors (WPT “setters” tests)

Avoid hardcoding WPT vectors: implement the algorithm.

## Approach

Build incrementally:

1. URL record model (scheme, credentials, host, port, path, query, fragment).
2. Parser state machine for common special schemes and basic hosts.
3. Canonical serialization and basic getters.
4. Relative URL parsing with base URL.
5. Full host parsing and `file:` handling as required by tests.
6. Setters (`set_*`) matching the standard and WPT fixtures.
7. Validation error collection when requested.

Run tests frequently while adding features.

## Scope

In scope for this suite (as required by `url_spec.mbt` and tests):

- `Url::parse(input, base?, validation_errors?) -> Url?`
- Serialization and getters: `to_string`, `href`, `protocol`, `username`,
  `password`, `host`, `hostname`, `port`, `pathname`, `search`, `hash`, `origin`
- Setters: `set_href`, `set_protocol`, `set_username`, `set_password`,
  `set_host`, `set_hostname`, `set_port`, `set_pathname`, `set_search`, `set_hash`

Repo-specific note (important):

- WPT fixtures are the canonical expected results; match them exactly.

Out of scope (not required by current tests):

- Networking, DNS, or fetch behavior

## Required API

Complete the declarations in `url_spec.mbt`.

Implementation notes:

- You can **freely decide** the project structure (modules/files/directories),
  the parsing strategy, and any internal data structures.
- Do **not** modify the following files:
  - `url_spec.mbt` - API specification
  - `specs/` folder - Reference documents and WPT fixtures
  - `*_pub_test.mbt` - Public test files (`url_valid_pub_test.mbt`, `url_invalid_pub_test.mbt`, `url_wpt_pub_test.mbt`, `url_wpt_setters_pub_test.mbt`)
  - `*_priv_test.mbt` - Private test files (intended for private testing, but available here in a full-public test setting)
- Implement the required declarations by adding new `.mbt` files as needed.
- **You may add additional test files** (e.g., xxx_test.mbt) if needed for testing and maintenance purposes

Required entry points:

- All `declare` declarations in `url_spec.mbt` (parsing, getters, serialization, setters, and validation error collection)

## Behavioral rules

- Follow the WHATWG algorithm; WPT fixtures are the canonical expected results.
- Serialization must be canonical and deterministic.
- Setters must match WPT setter semantics.
- When `validation_errors` is provided, collect non-fatal validation issues as required by fixtures.

## Test execution

```bash
cd url
moon test
```

Use `moon test --update` only if you intentionally change snapshots.

## Constraints

### 1. Test Requirements

**All tests must pass for task completion**:

The model should keep running until all tests pass.

- **Public tests** (`*_pub_test.mbt`): Test cases visible in this repository
- **Private tests** (`*_priv_test.mbt`): Additional test cases (available in this full-public test setting)

**Testing Process**:

Run all tests locally to verify your solution:

```bash
moon test
```

All tests (both `*_pub_test.mbt` and `*_priv_test.mbt`) must pass for task completion.

### 2. Code Quality Requirements

**Correctness**:

- Zero compiler errors, warnings, or diagnostics
- No runtime panics or unhandled edge cases
- Proper error handling with meaningful error messages

**Formatting**:

- Run `moon fmt` to format all code
- Run `moon info` to generate interface files (`.mbti`)
- Follow MoonBit style conventions consistently

**Implementation Integrity**:

- Solutions must be real algorithm implementations, not test-specific lookup tables
- No hardcoded mappings derived from WPT fixtures
- Implementation should work for arbitrary URLs within the supported subset

### 3. Software Engineering Standards

**Modularity and Organization**:

- **Use subdirectories** to organize code by functional area:
  - `model/` - URL record model
  - `parser/` - Parser state machine
  - `host/` - Host parsing and normalization
  - `serialize/` - Canonical serialization
  - `setters/` - Setter semantics
  - `types/` - Core data structures and errors
- Group related functionality together
- Avoid dumping all code in the root directory

**File Size Limits**:

- Please try to keep each file to at most **1000 lines of core code** (excluding blank lines and comments)
- Split large modules into focused, single-responsibility files
- Use meaningful file names that reflect their purpose

**Readability**:

- Clear, descriptive function and variable names
- Add comments for complex algorithms or non-obvious logic
- Document public APIs and key data structures
- Keep functions focused (prefer multiple small functions over large monolithic ones)

**Code Structure**:

- Logical separation of concerns (model → parsing → serialization → setters)
- Minimize coupling between modules
- Use appropriate abstractions (types, enums, structs)
- Avoid global mutable state

**Example directory structure**:

```
url/
├── moon.mod.json
├── moon.pkg.json
├── url_spec.mbt           # API declarations (do not modify)
├── url.mbt                # Main entry point
├── model/
│   └── url.mbt
├── parser/
│   └── parser.mbt
├── host/
│   └── host.mbt
├── serialize/
│   └── serialize.mbt
├── setters/
│   └── setters.mbt
└── types/
    ├── error.mbt
    └── validation.mbt
```

These standards ensure your code is maintainable, understandable, and follows professional software engineering practices.

## Documentation

**Write a comprehensive README.md**:

Your implementation must include a `README.md` file that documents:

- **Project overview**: What this parser implements and its purpose
- **Architecture**: High-level design decisions and module organization
- **Implementation approach**: Key algorithms, data structures, and parsing strategy
- **Usage examples**: How to use the API (parsing code, generating JSON)
- **Testing**: How to run tests and interpret results
- **Design decisions**: Rationale for important technical choices

The README should be written **based on your actual implementation** - describe the code you built, not generic information from specifications. It should help future developers understand your codebase quickly.

## External references

This environment has public network access. You may consult the WHATWG URL
Standard online, but treat the vendored spec files in `specs/` as the
authoritative baseline for behavior in this task.
