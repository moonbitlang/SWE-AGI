## Goal

Implement a MoonBit **HTML5 parser** compatible with the WHATWG HTML parsing
algorithm and this repository’s test suite. The authoritative repo reference is
vendored in:

- `html5/specs/html5.md`

## What This Task Is Really About

This is an exercise in implementing a **real HTML5 parser**:

- a tokenizer that follows the HTML parsing states
- a tree builder that constructs a DOM-like document
- a serializer / inspector used by tests

Avoid hardcoding: HTML parsing has many special cases and error-recovery rules.

## Approach

Build incrementally:

1. Tokenizer for common tags/text/comments and required states.
2. Tree builder for insertion modes needed by the suite.
3. Attribute handling and namespace/tag name rules.
4. Error collection for `parse_with_errors` where required.
5. Deterministic serialization via `Document::to_html()` / `Document::dump()`.

Run tests frequently while adding features.

Important: The core logic must be implemented in MoonBit.

## Scope

In scope for this suite:

- `parse`, `parse_with_errors`, `parse_with_scripting`, and `tokenize`
- A document model with node accessors/mutators used by tests
- Deterministic serialization/inspection outputs

Repo-specific note (important):

- The test suite defines observable behavior via `Document::dump()`/`to_html()`;
  match it exactly.

Out of scope (not required by current tests):

- Full browser integration (CSS layout, scripting runtime, networking)

## Required API

Complete the declarations in `html5_spec.mbt`.

Implementation notes:

- You can **freely decide** the project structure (modules/files/directories),
  the parsing strategy, and any internal data structures.
- Do **not** modify the following files:
  - `html5_spec.mbt` - API specification
  - `specs/` folder - Reference documents and fixtures
  - `*_pub_test.mbt` - Public test files (`html5_valid_pub_test.mbt`)
  - `*_priv_test.mbt` - Private test files (`html5_valid_priv_test.mbt`)
- Implement the required declarations by adding new `.mbt` files as needed.
- **You may add additional test files** (e.g., xxx_test.mbt) if needed for testing and maintenance purposes

Required entry points:

- `@html5.parse(input : String) -> Document`
- `@html5.parse_with_errors(input : String) -> (Document, Array[ParseError])`
- `@html5.parse_with_scripting(input : String) -> Document`
- `@html5.tokenize(input : String) -> (Array[Token], Array[ParseError])`
- `@html5.Document::to_html(self : Document) -> String`
- `@html5.Document::dump(self : Document) -> String`

## Behavioral rules

- Follow the WHATWG HTML parsing algorithm for the subset exercised by tests.
- Handle malformed HTML with HTML5-style error recovery (not strict XML rules).
- Tokenization and tree construction must be deterministic.
- Serialization/inspection output must match tests exactly.

## Test execution

```bash
cd html5
moon test
```

Use `moon test --update` only if you intentionally change snapshots.

If tests hang due to infinite loops or run out of memory, `try.py` (requires python3) can run each test individually with timeout and OOM detection:

```bash
python3 try.py
python3 try.py --timeout 60              # custom timeout (default: 30s)
python3 try.py --test-file foo_test.mbt  # run specific file
python3 try.py --json                    # output as JSONL
```

This is slower than `moon test` since it runs tests one by one.


## Constraints

### 1. Test Requirements

**All tests must pass for task completion**:

The model should keep running until all tests pass.

- **Public tests** (`*_pub_test.mbt`): ~10% of total cases, visible in this repository for development and debugging
- **Private tests** (`*_priv_test.mbt`): ~90% of total cases, **hidden** in the evaluation environment

**⚠️ CRITICAL - Private Test Evaluation**:

Passing only the public tests is **INSUFFICIENT** and will result in task failure. The task is complete **only when both public and private test suites pass**.

**Why Private Tests Matter**:
- **Coverage**: Private tests represent 90% of the total evaluation - they are the primary measure of success
- **Comprehensiveness**: Validate full HTML parsing/tree construction behavior, including edge cases, corner cases, and subtle algorithmic rules not exposed in public tests
- **Real-world scenarios**: Test combinations and patterns that occur in real HTML documents but may not be obvious from the spec
- **Anti-cheating**: Prevent solutions that merely memorize or hardcode responses to public test cases

**Evaluation Process**:

**Step 1 - Local Testing (Development Phase)**:

Before submitting for evaluation, ensure all public tests pass locally by running `moon test` in your project directory. Local testing helps you debug and iterate quickly, but **passing local tests alone does NOT complete this task**.

**Step 2 - Server Evaluation (REQUIRED - Task Completion)**:

⚠️ **MANDATORY STEP**: You **MUST** evaluate your solution against the full test suite (public + private) using the evaluation server. This is **NOT OPTIONAL**.

**The task is incomplete until server evaluation confirms all tests pass.**

To evaluate your solution:

```bash
swe-agi-submit --project html5 --request-id eval-001
```

The server will respond with:
- `status`: "pass" or "fail"
- `summary`: Total test count, passed count, failed count
- `errors`: Up to 5 failure messages (if any tests failed)

**Success criteria for task completion**: 
- `status` == "pass"
- `summary.failed` == 0 (all tests must pass, including all private tests)

**Important Notes**:
- You cannot see private test results during development
- Server evaluation is the **only way** to verify your solution against private tests
- **Do not consider the task complete** until server evaluation returns success
- If evaluation fails, fix the issues and re-evaluate until all tests pass

### 2. Code Quality Requirements

**Correctness**:
- Zero compiler errors, warnings, or diagnostics
- No runtime panics or unhandled edge cases
- Proper error handling with meaningful error messages

**Formatting**:
- Run `moon fmt` to format all code
- Run `moon info` to generate interface files (`.mbti`)
- Follow MoonBit style conventions consistently

**Implementation Integrity**:
- Solutions must be real parsers, not test-specific lookup tables
- No hardcoded mappings derived from test fixtures
- Implementation should work for arbitrary HTML inputs in the supported subset

### 3. Software Engineering Standards

**Modularity and Organization**:
- **Use subdirectories** to organize code by functional area:
  - `tokenizer/` - Tokenization state machine
  - `tree_builder/` - Insertion modes and DOM construction
  - `dom/` - Document/node model and utilities
  - `serialize/` - HTML serialization and dump/inspect helpers
  - `types/` - Core data structures and errors
- Group related functionality together
- Avoid dumping all code in the root directory

**File Size Limits**:
- Please try to keep each file to at most **1000 lines of core code** (excluding blank lines and comments)
- Split large modules into focused, single-responsibility files
- Use meaningful file names that reflect their purpose

**Readability**:
- Clear, descriptive function and variable names
- Add comments for complex algorithms or non-obvious logic
- Document public APIs and key data structures
- Keep functions focused (prefer multiple small functions over large monolithic ones)

**Code Structure**:
- Logical separation of concerns (tokenization → tree building → output)
- Minimize coupling between modules
- Use appropriate abstractions (types, enums, structs)
- Avoid global mutable state

**Example directory structure**:
```
html5/
├── moon.mod.json
├── moon.pkg.json
├── html5_spec.mbt         # API declarations (do not modify)
├── html5.mbt              # Main entry point
├── tokenizer/
│   └── tokenizer.mbt
├── tree_builder/
│   └── builder.mbt
├── dom/
│   ├── document.mbt
│   └── node.mbt
├── serialize/
│   ├── html.mbt
│   └── dump.mbt
└── types/
    ├── token.mbt
    └── error.mbt
```

These standards ensure your code is maintainable, understandable, and follows professional software engineering practices.

## Documentation

**Write a comprehensive README.md**:

Your implementation must include a `README.md` file that documents:

- **Project overview**: What this parser implements and its purpose
- **Architecture**: High-level design decisions and module organization
- **Implementation approach**: Key algorithms, data structures, and parsing strategy
- **Usage examples**: How to use the API (parsing code, generating JSON)
- **Testing**: How to run tests and interpret results
- **Design decisions**: Rationale for important technical choices

The README should be written **based on your actual implementation** - describe the code you built, not generic information from specifications. It should help future developers understand your codebase quickly.

## External references

This environment has public network access. You may consult HTML parsing
references online, but treat the vendored spec files in `specs/` as the
authoritative baseline for behavior in this task.
