    "message": "bugreport tests: tighten up \"git bugreport -s hooks\" test\n\nAmend a test added in 788a776069b (bugreport: collect list of\npopulated hooks, 2020-05-07) to \"test_cmp\" for the expected output,\ninstead of selectively using \"grep\" to check for specific things we\neither expect or don't expect in the output.\n\nAs noted in a preceding commit our .git/hooks directory already\ncontains *.sample hooks, so we have no need to clobber the\nprepare-commit-msg.sample hook in particular.\n\nInstead we should assert that those *.sample hooks are not included in\nthe output, and for good measure let's add a new \"unknown-hook\", to\ncheck that we only look through our own known hooks. See\ncfe853e66be (hook-list.h: add a generated list of hooks, like\nconfig-list.h, 2021-09-26) for how we generate that data.\n\nWe're intentionally not piping the \"actual\" output through \"sort\" or\nsimilar, we'd also like to check that our reported hooks are sorted.\n\nSigned-off-by: \u00c6var Arnfj\u00f6r\u00f0 Bjarmason <avarab@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>\n",
