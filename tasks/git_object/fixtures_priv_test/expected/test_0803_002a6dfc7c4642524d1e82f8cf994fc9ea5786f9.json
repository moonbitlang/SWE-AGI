    "message": "merge-strategies.txt: do not imply using copy detection is desired\n\nStating that the recursive strategy \"currently cannot make use of\ndetected copies\" implies that this is a technical shortcoming of the\ncurrent algorithm.  I disagree with that.  I don't see how copies could\npossibly be used in a sane fashion in a merge algorithm -- would we\npropagate changes in one file on one side of history to each copy of\nthat file when merging?  That makes no sense to me.  I cannot think of\nanything else that would make sense either.  Change the wording to\nsimply state that we ignore any copies.\n\nAcked-by: Derrick Stolee <dstolee@microsoft.com>\nAcked-by: Johannes Schindelin <johannes.schindelin@gmx.de>\nSigned-off-by: Elijah Newren <newren@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>\n",
