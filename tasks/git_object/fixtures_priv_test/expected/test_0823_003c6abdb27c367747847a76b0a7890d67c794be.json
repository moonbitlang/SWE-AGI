    "message": "dwim_ref: fix dangling symref warning\n\nIf we encounter a symref that is dangling, in most cases we will warn\nabout it. The one exception is a dangling HEAD, as that indicates a\nbranch yet to be born.\n\nHowever, the check in dwim_ref was not quite right. If we were fed\nsomething like \"HEAD^0\" we would try to resolve \"HEAD\", see that it is\ndangling, and then check whether the _original_ string we got was\n\"HEAD\" (which it wasn't in this case). And that makes no sense; the\ndangling thing we found was not \"HEAD^0\" but rather \"HEAD\".\n\nFixing this squelches a scary warning from \"submodule summary HEAD\" (and\nconsequently \"git status\" with status.submodulesummary set) in an empty\nrepo, as the submodule script calls \"git rev-parse -q --verify HEAD^0\".\n\nSigned-off-by: Jeff King <peff@peff.net>\nSigned-off-by: Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>\n",
