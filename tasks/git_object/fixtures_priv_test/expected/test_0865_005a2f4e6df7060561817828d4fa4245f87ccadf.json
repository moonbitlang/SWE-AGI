    "message": "gitk: Fix bugs in the Find function\n\nThis fixes the problem reported by Brian Downing where searching for\na string that doesn't exist would give a Tcl error.  The basic problem\nwas that we weren't reading the data for the last commit since it\nwasn't terminated with a null.  This effectively adds a null on the end\n(if there isn't one already) to make sure we process the last commit.\n\nThis also makes the yellow background behind instances of the search\nstring appear more consistently, and fixes a bug where the \"/\" key\nwould just find the same commit again and again instead of advancing.\n\nSigned-off-by: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>",
