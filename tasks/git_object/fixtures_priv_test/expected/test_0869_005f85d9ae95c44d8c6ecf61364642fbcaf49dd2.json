The null tree does not\nhave to be written out in the object store as it won't be part\nof the result, and it is a prime example for using the new\npretend_sha1_file() function.\n\ngit-blame needs to register an arbitrary data to in-core index\nwhile annotating a working tree file (or standard input), but\ngit-blame is a read-only application and the user of it could\neven lack the privilege to write into the object store; it is\nanother good example for pretend_sha1_file().\n\nSigned-off-by: Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>\n",
